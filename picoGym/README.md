# Exercises from picoGym

As a part of my training for future CTFs, I've been using some of the resources from picoCTF as educational exercises. Basically everything here is brand-new to me, so it probably won't seem very polished, but that's kind of the point. I'm eager to learn, and I wasn't interested in waiting to be allowed to take the one undergraduate computer security course at my university, so I figured I would take it upon myself to get started. I'll continue to update this repo as I complete more exercises and (hopefully) they will become more polished over time as I gain experience and develop skills.

## Thank you
I wanted to take a moment to thank the team that puts together picoCTF and all of its incredible resources. Thank you for allowing people like me to learn, practice, and demonstrate technical knowledge and skills, and for making it free for all to use.
