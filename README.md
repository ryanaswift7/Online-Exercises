# Online Exercises:
### (A collection of all of the exercises I've either completed or am currently working on)


## Resources (so far):

picoCTF/picoGym
HackTheBox

(I'm also working on my (ISC)2 Certified in Cybersecurity Cert, so if there are any interesting exercises from that, I will put them here as well)



## A bit about me and my current skill level

Despite being in my third year of a CS degree, I basically don't know anything about anything when it comes to security and technical knowledge. And since there aren't very many opportunities to learn relevant skills and information through my coursework, I've turned to some online resources to help teach me the things I'll need to know.

Although I do have some familiarity with Linux (mostly Ubuntu-based desktop distros), and I'm pretty comfortable with the command line, I'm essentially starting from the absolute beginning in terms of technical knowledge.

As such, do not expect this repo to be some sort of showcase of my abilities. Instead, view it as a glimpse inside my learning process. Honestly, the initial exercises are probably going to be pretty rough, but the goal is to improve over time and document that improvement- for myself as much as anyone else.


TL;DR
I'm dumb right now. This is me trying to get smart.
